# 🔍 Order History Debugging Guide

## ✅ How Orders Work

### **Flow:**
```
User Places Order → Saved to OrdersDB → Admin Views Order History
```

---

## 📊 Complete Test Flow

### **Step 1: Place Order (User)**
```
1. Login: test@gmail.com / 123456
2. Add Espresso x2 to cart
3. Click Cart (bottom nav)
4. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
5. Click "Place Order"
6. ✅ See "Order Complete!" dialog
7. Click "OK"
```

### **Step 2: Check LogCat**
```
Look for these messages:
✓ Checkout: Creating order - User: test, Total: 700, Items: 1
✓ MongoDBService: Saving order - User: test, Items: 1, Total: 700
✓ MongoDBService: Order saved successfully - ID: xxx, Total orders: 1
✓ Checkout: Order saved successfully - ID: xxx
```

### **Step 3: View in Admin (Important!)**
```
1. Go back to welcome screen
2. Login: admin@gmail.com / 123456
3. ✅ Goes to Admin Dashboard
4. Click "Order History"
5. ✅ Should see the order!
```

### **Step 4: Check Admin LogCat**
```
Look for these messages:
✓ MongoDBService: Getting all orders - Total in DB: 1
✓ MongoDBService: Order 0 - User: test, Total: 700
✓ MongoDBService: Returning 1 orders to callback
✓ OrderHistory: Loaded 1 orders
```

## 🐛 If Orders Don't Show

### **Problem 1: Orders Not Saving**

**Check LogCat for:**
```
Checkout: Creating order...
MongoDBService: Saving order...
MongoDBService: Order saved successfully
```

**If you see errors:**
- Order not saving to database
- Check CheckoutActivity is calling saveOrder()

**Fix:** Already implemented - orders save with status "completed"

---

### **Problem 2: Orders Not Loading**

**Check LogCat for:**
```
MongoDBService: Getting all orders - Total in DB: X
OrderHistory: Loaded X orders
```

**If Total in DB is 0:**
- No orders in database
- Place an order first

**If Loaded orders is 0:**
- Orders exist but not loading
- Check getAllOrders() method

**Fix:** Already implemented with debug logging

---

### **Problem 3: Empty Order History**

**Possible Causes:**
1. No orders placed yet
2. Orders in different database
3. App data cleared

**Solution:**
1. Place a test order
2. Check LogCat for save confirmation
3. View admin order history
4. Check LogCat for load confirmation

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### **1. Clear App Data (Fresh Start)**
```
Settings → Apps → CoffeeClick → Clear Data
OR
Uninstall and reinstall app
```

### **2. Place Test Order**
```
1. Login as user
2. Add items
3. Checkout
4. Place order
5. ✅ See success dialog
6. Check LogCat: "Order saved successfully"
```

### **3. View in Admin**
```
1. Logout
2. Login as admin
3. Order History
4. ✅ See order
5. Check LogCat: "Loaded X orders"
```

---

## 📱 What to Check in LogCat

### **Filter by: MongoDBService**

**When Placing Order:**
```
MongoDBService: Saving order - User: test, Items: 2, Total: 1100
MongoDBService: Order saved successfully - ID: abc123, Total orders: 1
```

**When Viewing Order History:**
```
MongoDBService: Getting all orders - Total in DB: 1
MongoDBService: Orders JSON: [{"id":"abc123","userId":"user-001",...}]
MongoDBService: Order 0 - User: test, Total: 1100
MongoDBService: Returning 1 orders to callback
```

**In OrderHistoryActivity:**
```
OrderHistory: Loaded 1 orders
```

---

## ✅ Current Implementation

### **Order Saving (CheckoutActivity):**
```java
Order order = new Order(userId, username, cartList, total);
order.setStatus("completed");  // ✅ Set as completed

MongoDBService.getInstance(this).saveOrder(order, callback);
// Shows: "Order Complete!" dialog
// Logs: "Order saved successfully"
```

### **Order Retrieval (OrderHistoryActivity):**
```java
MongoDBService.getInstance(this).getAllOrders(callback);
// Logs: "Getting all orders - Total in DB: X"
// Logs: "Loaded X orders"
// Shows in RecyclerView
```
